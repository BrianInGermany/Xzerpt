# IdeaStackr: a framework for clustering research

## Description:

IdeaStackr uses idea clustering and source management to bring structure to your research data and keep track of what ideas you found where. 

Record your ideas in an web interface and then generate idea cards you can cluster into stacks on your desk.

## Steps:

### 1. Data collection

- Conduct research and fill out idea templates:

  <a href url="http://ideastackr.herokuapp.com"><img src=".\exampleImages\ideastackrUI.png" alt="UIPicture" width="70%"/></a>

  - The idea template contains the following fields:

    - `Type`: _quote_, _paraphrase_, or _own opinion_
    - `Source`: unique name or nickname you keep source details saved under (wherever)
    - `Page`: page number in source (0 for without pages i.e. website)
    - `Topic`: brief summary of idea
    - `Statement`: the idea itself

  - Source details should contain the name/nickname used in the csv and a way to find the source (URL, book title, ISBN, etc):
    ```txt
    ideastackr
      https://github.com/BrianInGermany/IdeaStackr
    brian
      https://github.com/BrianInGermany
    bible
      https://www.bible.com/
    ```
  - Pressing `Cache Card` will add the card to temporary storage. When you're done caching cards, click `Download and Clear Cache` to get your CSV file.
  
  - Caveat: The _Â¥_ symbol is the delimiter and using one in the template will break the CSV creation. Substitute them with some other character. 
  
### 2. Card generation

- Click the `Create Cards from CSV` button to open the card creator.
- Open the generated CSV file, copy and paste its contents and press generate:

- Sample output:

- Print the website using the browser to get your cards (print two-to-a-page for A6-size index cards).
  - Works for A4 or US-Letter paper size.

### 3. Card clustering

- Create a coordinate system on your desk with 1, 2, 3, 4 on one axis and A, B, C, D, E on the other. Make it big enough to put one idea card in each cell.
- Cluster similar idea cards together. Once two or three cards are in one stack, name the stack. Write down its name on this chart ([pdf link](categoryTable.pdf)):

- **Rename stacks as often as you like!** The point is to have an appropriate name at the end. You may also want to merge or split stacks as you go.
- When you are finished, you have stacks that represent the low-level structure of your information, like this:

### 4. Stack clustering

- Once you have a set of named stacks on your table, label each stack with a post-it according to your names in the chart.
- Now we're going to cluster the clusters to create a structure for our research!
- Repeat step 3. with a blank chart, this time clustering stacks instead of individual cards and naming these superstacks instead of the stacks.


### 5. Sequentialization

- For each superstack, put its stacks in a logical order. The resulting sequence represents the high-level structure of the information you collected. 
- Optional: For each stack, put its cards in a logical order. This is your low-level structure.
- You should now have one big heap of cards containing ordered superstacks which contain ordered stacks which contain individual cards.
- This is your table of contents!

### 6. Composition

- The final step of the framework is to weave your superstacks, stacks and cards into a new composition. 
- Use ordered superstacks and stacks to write table of contents.
- Put the heap of ordered stacks and superstacks on your desk, and integrate the cards' contents one by one into your paper, presentation or speech.


## Background: Excerpting

The system behind IdeaStackr is called excerpting (German: *Exzerpieren*)
